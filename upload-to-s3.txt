================================================================================

STEP 3: CONFIGURE S3 STATIC WEBSITE HOSTING
--------------------------------------------

1. Create S3 Bucket:
   - Go to: https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/
   - Click "Create bucket"
   - Bucket name: Choose unique name (e.g., "tinctoriacottage-website")
   - Region: Select your preferred region
   - UNCHECK "Block all public access" 
   - Click "Create bucket"

2. Enable Static Website Hosting:
   - Select your bucket
   - Go to "Properties" tab
   - Scroll to "Static website hosting" section
   - Click "Edit"
   - Select "Enable"
   - Index document: index.html
   - Error document: (optional) error.html or index.html
   - Click "Save changes"
   - **IMPORTANT**: Copy the "Bucket website endpoint" URL shown


STEP 4: SET BUCKET PERMISSIONS AND POLICIES
--------------------------------------------

1. Configure Bucket Policy:
   - Select your bucket
   - Go to "Permissions" tab
   - Scroll to "Bucket policy" section
   - Click "Edit"
   - Copy the JSON from "bucket-policy-tinctoriacottage.json" file
   - **REPLACE** "YOUR-BUCKET-NAME" with your actual bucket name
   - Click "Save changes"

2. Verify Public Access Settings:
   - In "Permissions" tab
   - "Block public access" section should show:
     * Block all public access: OFF
     * Block public access to buckets and objects granted through 
       new access control lists (ACLs): OFF
     * Block public access to buckets and objects granted through 
       any access control lists (ACLs): OFF
     * Block public access to buckets and objects granted through 
       new public bucket or access point policies: OFF
     * Block public access to buckets and objects granted through 
       any public bucket or access point policies: OFF


UPLOADING YOUR FILES
--------------------

Option 1: Using AWS Console (Drag & Drop):
   - Select your bucket
   - Click "Upload" button
   - Drag and drop these folders/files:
     * All .html files (bookpg.html, creationpg.html, etc.)
     * Graphics/ folder
     * images/ folder
     * includes/ folder (if needed for other files)
     * Photos/ folder
     * help/ folder
     * New/ folder with its .html files
     * eBay/ folder with paypal_payment_msg.html
     * Any other assets (CSS, JS, etc.)
   - Click "Upload"

Option 2: Using AWS CLI:
   Install AWS CLI first: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/
   Then run (replace YOUR-BUCKET-NAME):
   
   aws s3 sync . s3://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ --exclude "*.shtml" --exclude "*.ssi" --exclude ".git/*" --exclude "Dir/*" --exclude "cgi-bin/*" --exclude "fpdb/*" --exclude "stats/*"


UPDATING INTERNAL LINKS
------------------------

Before uploading, you need to update ALL .shtml references to .html:
- This affects navigation links in your HTML files
- I can help update these automatically
- See the list of files that need updating in the next section


TESTING YOUR SITE
-----------------

1. After upload, visit your bucket website endpoint URL
2. Test all navigation links
3. Check that images load correctly
4. Test the MailTo popup windows


OPTIONAL: CUSTOM DOMAIN SETUP
------------------------------

If you want to use www.tinctoriacottage.com instead of the S3 URL:

1. Bucket name MUST match your domain (e.g., "www.tinctoriacottage.com")
2. Configure DNS in Route 53 or your domain registrar
3. Point to your S3 website endpoint
4. Consider using CloudFront CDN for HTTPS support


COST ESTIMATE
-------------

S3 costs are very low for static sites:
- Storage: ~$0.023 per GB/month
- Data transfer OUT: First 1GB free, then ~$0.09 per GB
- GET requests: $0.0004 per 1,000 requests

Estimated monthly cost for a small site: $1-5/month
(Much cheaper than traditional web hosting!)
