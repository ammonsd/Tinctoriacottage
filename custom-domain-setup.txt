CUSTOM DOMAIN SETUP FOR S3 WEBSITE
tinctoria.com → S3 Static Website
========================================

PREREQUISITES:
- Your domain registrar login (where you bought tinctoria.com)
- AWS account access
- Existing S3 bucket with website hosting enabled

========================================
OPTION 1: Using AWS Route 53 (Recommended)
========================================

STEP 1: Create Correctly Named S3 Buckets
------------------------------------------
You need TWO buckets with exact domain names:

Bucket 1: tinctoria.com (main bucket)
  - Already created with your website files
  - Static website hosting enabled
  - Index document: index.html

Bucket 2: www.tinctoria.com (redirect bucket)
  - Create new bucket
  - Enable static website hosting
  - Choose "Redirect requests" option
  - Target bucket: tinctoria.com
  - Protocol: http

STEP 2: Transfer Domain to Route 53 (or use existing DNS)
------------------------------------------
If domain is NOT at Route 53:
1. Go to Route 53 console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/
2. Click "Hosted zones" → "Create hosted zone"
3. Domain name: tinctoria.com
4. Type: Public hosted zone
5. Click "Create hosted zone"
6. NOTE the 4 nameserver addresses (ns-xxxx.awsdns-xx.com)

STEP 3: Update Domain Nameservers
------------------------------------------
At your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.):
1. Log in to your domain registrar
2. Find DNS/Nameserver settings for tinctoria.com
3. Replace existing nameservers with the 4 Route 53 nameservers
4. Save changes (can take 24-48 hours to propagate)

STEP 4: Create Route 53 DNS Records
------------------------------------------
In Route 53 hosted zone for tinctoria.com:

Record 1 (Root domain):
  - Click "Create record"
  - Record name: (leave blank)
  - Record type: A
  - Toggle "Alias" ON
  - Route traffic to: "Alias to S3 website endpoint"
  - Region: (select your bucket's region)
  - S3 endpoint: tinctoria.com (should appear in dropdown)
  - Click "Create records"

Record 2 (www subdomain):
  - Click "Create record"
  - Record name: www
  - Record type: A
  - Toggle "Alias" ON
  - Route traffic to: "Alias to S3 website endpoint"
  - Region: (select your bucket's region)
  - S3 endpoint: www.tinctoria.com (should appear in dropdown)
  - Click "Create records"

========================================
OPTION 2: Using Existing DNS Provider
========================================

If you want to keep your domain at current registrar:

STEP 1: Get S3 Website Endpoint
------------------------------------------
1. Go to S3 console
2. Select your bucket
3. Go to Properties → Static website hosting
4. Copy the "Bucket website endpoint" URL
   Example: tinctoria.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

STEP 2: Update DNS at Your Registrar
------------------------------------------
At your domain registrar's DNS settings:

For Root Domain (tinctoria.com):
  - Type: CNAME or ALIAS (if supported)
  - Name: @ (or leave blank)
  - Value: [your-bucket-endpoint from Step 1]
  - TTL: 3600

For WWW Subdomain (www.tinctoria.com):
  - Type: CNAME
  - Name: www
  - Value: [your-bucket-endpoint from Step 1]
  - TTL: 3600

NOTE: Some registrars don't support CNAME at root. If that's the case:
  - Use A record pointing to S3 IP (not recommended, can change)
  - OR use Route 53 (Option 1 above)

========================================
OPTIONAL: ADD HTTPS (SSL/TLS)
========================================

To enable HTTPS (https://tinctoria.com):

REQUIREMENTS:
- Must use CloudFront (AWS CDN)
- Must use Route 53 for DNS
- Free SSL certificate via AWS Certificate Manager

Steps:
1. Request SSL certificate in AWS Certificate Manager (us-east-1 region)
2. Create CloudFront distribution pointing to S3 bucket
3. Attach SSL certificate to CloudFront
4. Update Route 53 A records to point to CloudFront (not S3)

(This is more advanced - let me know if you want detailed steps)

========================================
VERIFICATION
========================================

After DNS propagates (can take 2-48 hours):

1. Test in browser:
   - http://tinctoria.com
   - http://www.tinctoria.com

2. Check DNS propagation:
   - Visit: https://www.whatsmydns.net/
   - Enter: tinctoria.com
   - Check worldwide propagation

3. Troubleshooting:
   - Clear browser cache
   - Try incognito/private mode
   - Use different DNS: 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS)

========================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
========================================

1. S3 bucket name MUST exactly match domain name
   - If using www.tinctoria.com → bucket must be www.tinctoria.com
   - If using tinctoria.com → bucket must be tinctoria.com

2. DNS propagation takes time
   - Changes can take 2-48 hours
   - Be patient!

3. Existing bucket?
   - If your current bucket has a different name, you'll need to:
     a) Create new bucket with exact domain name
     b) Copy all files to new bucket
     c) Configure new bucket for static hosting
     d) Update bucket policy with new bucket name

4. Cost:
   - Route 53 hosted zone: $0.50/month
   - DNS queries: $0.40 per million queries
   - S3 hosting remains cheap (pennies/month)
